# ACTIVE TASK LEDGER — SINDAREALEST2
Updated: 2026-10-23 — owner-confirmed report-then-continue protocol

Only current, actionable tasks belong here. Historical run-by-run evidence is in [TEST-RESULTS.md](TEST-RESULTS.md); do not treat old checkpoint rows as current.

| ID | Status | Next action / acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| HANDOFF-CLEANUP | COMPLETED — verify links on each future change | Superseded dated prompts were removed; duplicate audit history consolidated into TEST-RESULTS.md; canonical state/prompt pointers updated. |
| WORKFLOW-EFFICIENCY | APPLIED; source validation PASS | Commit `51e6f937b56c9c8ff04f4bbfd82298c3f8307d02`; [run #39843531405](https://github.com/chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin/actions/runs/39843531405) PASS. Docs/README and workflow-only changes no longer trigger needless deployment/capture; Admin smoke is manual; stale validation/review runs are superseded. |
| HERO-TEMP-HIDDEN | PAUSED BY OWNER — DO NOT TOUCH | Owner says leave Hero unchanged for now and return to it only after other storefront work is complete. Do not edit Hero markup/CSS/assets, run Hero-specific rework, or call it PASS during this pause. Preserve the uploaded image and derivative. |
| STOREFRONT-VISUAL-AUDIT | ORDER SECTION LIVE CAPTURED — OWNER VISUAL ACCEPTANCE PENDING | Source/test CI PASS at exact SHA `cb8901b7218964e0609b5048a9ea28bfb52c42f7` (#39894447637). Authorized non-Hero-only live Preview capture succeeded (#39894447648): 8 element-only Light/Dark screenshots across four viewport sizes; alias-matched deployed SHA exact; artifact #12476071825. Owner visual acceptance remains PENDING; do not mark PASS/LOCKED until owner reviews. See CURRENT-STATE.md and TEST-RESULTS.md. |
| QR-PAYMENT-CONTRACT | BLOCKED ON TRUSTED BACKEND CONTRACT/CONFIG | Keep fail-closed: no QR or transfer request until trusted order status and complete receiver/payment instructions exist. Do not modify Admin/backend in this branch. |

## Working protocol (owner-approved 2026-10-23)
- One active acceptance item at a time; do not spread effort across multiple unfinished main tasks.
- While CI/deploy/capture is running, immediately do independent, safe work that advances the active item. No idling or duplicate workflow runs; avoid editing the same code under validation.
- Mandatory: a progress report is not a stop. Continue the next safe step automatically without waiting for the owner to say “continue.” While CI/deploy/capture runs, do independent non-conflicting work, then inspect results. Stop only for required owner visual acceptance/decision, missing permission, or a genuine external blocker; keep doing independent safe work while blocked.
- Reuse valid evidence for unchanged code; rerun only missing/stale/impacted checks. Tie every result to exact SHA and deployment.
- Separate code-test PASS, Preview deployment PASS, live screenshot evidence, and owner visual acceptance. Owner PASS locks the item until explicit permission to reopen.
- Current active item is the next non-Hero storefront visual-audit section. Hero is explicitly paused by the owner and must remain untouched until the other agreed work is completed.

## Guardrails
- Repo `chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin`; branch `fix/liquid-glass-audit-2026-10-19`.
- PR #108 stays OPEN and unmerged.
- Preview only. Never touch Production, `main`, Admin branch, DNS, D1/R2 data/config, bindings/secrets/Access, backend/API/auth, or product/catalog data.
- Preserve `public/images/hero-upload/tb_image_share_1792519964514 (1).png` and its derivative unchanged. Hero is temporarily hidden by owner request; do not restore obsolete `hero-sd-gl052.png`.
- Re-fetch branch HEAD, PR status, workflow runs and deployed Preview SHA before claiming PASS.


## Latest execution ledger — 2026-10-23

- **FULLSCREEN-GALLERY-A11Y:** code fix committed in [8b576e0](https://github.com/chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin/commit/8b576e0f6c6ee07eebc24ef54cd4db5812241d79); active fullscreen image alt text and inactive preloaded-layer accessibility are synchronized. Regression assertions added. Source/test CI PASS at final SHA `0f7151a95391fbe55c59d6c426b458f6e075d7ce`.
- **HERO-CAPTURE-GUARD:** applied in [0f7151a](https://github.com/chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin/commit/0f7151a95391fbe55c59d6c426b458f6e075d7ce); manual Hero authorization defaults false, and push-triggered comprehensive capture requires an explicit approval marker. Run [#39890961242](https://github.com/chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin/actions/runs/39890961242) correctly SKIPPED.
- **PREVIEW-DEPLOY:** PASS at exact SHA `0f7151a95391fbe55c59d6c426b458f6e075d7ce`, [run #39890961316](https://github.com/chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin/actions/runs/39890961316). This is not visual acceptance.
- **VISUAL ACCEPTANCE:** still pending authorized non-Hero-only live screenshots tied to exact deployed SHA and owner review. Earlier run #39890856540 was cancelled; local fixture capture was cancelled and live capture/deployment verification were skipped. No evidence that it completed a 128-image live capture.
