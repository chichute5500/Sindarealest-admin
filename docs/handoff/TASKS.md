# ACTIVE TASK LEDGER — SINDAREALEST2
Updated: 2026-10-23

Only current, actionable tasks belong here. Historical run-by-run evidence is in [TEST-RESULTS.md](TEST-RESULTS.md); do not treat old checkpoint rows as current.

| ID | Status | Next action / acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| HANDOFF-CLEANUP | COMPLETED — verify links on each future change | Superseded dated prompts were removed; duplicate audit history consolidated into TEST-RESULTS.md; canonical state/prompt pointers updated. |
| WORKFLOW-EFFICIENCY | APPLIED; source validation PASS | Commit `51e6f937b56c9c8ff04f4bbfd82298c3f8307d02`; [run #39843531405](https://github.com/chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin/actions/runs/39843531405) PASS. Docs/README and workflow-only changes no longer trigger needless deployment/capture; Admin smoke is manual; stale validation/review runs are superseded. |
| HERO-TEMP-HIDDEN | CODE TESTS PASS; VISUAL ACCEPTANCE PENDING | Owner requested temporary image removal. Verify latest Actions and exact deployed SHA; inspect actual Preview mobile/desktop Light/Dark. Confirm no empty frame, reserved blank space or layout regression. This is not Hero acceptance. |
| STOREFRONT-VISUAL-AUDIT | PAUSED UNTIL HIDDEN LAYOUT VERIFIED | Do not resume unrelated visual redesign until temporary Hero state is verified. Then continue from current evidence, not old percentages. |
| QR-PAYMENT-CONTRACT | BLOCKED ON TRUSTED BACKEND CONTRACT/CONFIG | Keep fail-closed: no QR or transfer request until trusted order status and complete receiver/payment instructions exist. Do not modify Admin/backend in this branch. |

## Guardrails
- Repo `chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin`; branch `fix/liquid-glass-audit-2026-10-19`.
- PR #108 stays OPEN and unmerged.
- Preview only. Never touch Production, `main`, Admin branch, DNS, D1/R2 data/config, bindings/secrets/Access, backend/API/auth, or product/catalog data.
- Preserve `public/images/hero-upload/tb_image_share_1792519964514 (1).png` and its derivative unchanged. Hero is temporarily hidden by owner request; do not restore obsolete `hero-sd-gl052.png`.
- Re-fetch branch HEAD, PR status, workflow runs and deployed Preview SHA before claiming PASS.
