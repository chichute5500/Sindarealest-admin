# SinDarealest ADMIN — trạng thái bàn giao mới nhất

**Trạng thái hiện tại:** `SOURCE CI PASS; LOCAL PLAYWRIGHT PASS; CONFIGURED PREVIEW DIAGNOSTIC PASS; VISUAL PARITY NOT ACCEPTED; AUTHENTICATED QA NOT TESTED`
**Tiến độ tổng thể ước tính:** **48%** — ước lượng quản lý, không phải tỷ lệ test pass.
**Repository/nhánh được phép sửa:** `chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin` / `feature/admin-isolated-handoff-2026-10-20`.
**Source SHA gần nhất đã kiểm thử:** `45f630e99cfd1dd047c234f0fb42fa197d9bc978`; CSS UI change `1fb56f7b5773876c581847bf44abbef1c5c16a67` cũng có Run #157 PASS. Run #158 (45f630e99cfd1dd047c234f0fb42fa197d9bc978) xác nhận npm run check, npm test, local Playwright và configured Preview diagnostic PASS. [Run #157](https://github.com/chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin/actions/runs/39615192697) · [Run #158](https://github.com/chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin/actions/runs/39615417216).
**Bằng chứng lịch sử run #151:** Source `cf594677550f63ddf92ebdba5aea87587dbfe029`, artifact 151; giữ lại như lịch sử, không coi là test SHA mới nhất.
**HEAD hiện tại sẽ thay đổi bởi commit bàn giao tài liệu này**; không coi commit tài liệu mới là source-test SHA. Local checkout/Git working tree chưa xác minh được.
**Preview diagnostic gần nhất:** PASS trong run #158 trên source/test SHA `45f630e99cfd1dd047c234f0fb42fa197d9bc978`; chỉ xác nhận URL/configuration được workflow kiểm tra, không xác nhận mọi deployment hoặc authenticated real-backend flows.
**PR #111:** OPEN/unmerged, mixed-scope; latest GitHub filename list returned 1,112 paths (+38,619/−392): `docs/` 1,050 paths including 913 PNG assets; 24 Functions, 2 migrations, 5 scripts, 24 tests, 2 workflows, and root/data/public/package files including unrelated `public/index.html`. Chưa merge-ready. **PR #108:** OPEN/unmerged. Không merge hai PR.
**Chưa nghiệm thu:** visual parity đủ 12 nhóm màn hình; authenticated business-flow/backend QA; semantic/security audit toàn bộ PR #111; tương thích migration/ledger từ xa.
**Tạm hoãn theo yêu cầu chủ sở hữu:** lỗi lưu ảnh sản phẩm và migration PRE/PRO (`DEFERRED_BY_OWNER / NOT VERIFIED`).
**Rào chắn:** chỉ ADMIN branch; không sửa `main`/website tĩnh; không Production deploy; không chạy setup/migration; không sửa secrets/Cloudflare Access; không thao tác dữ liệu D1/R2 từ xa; không dùng TinyFish.

- npm run check: PASS
- npm test: PASS
- Local source Playwright matrix: PASS; 59 real PNGs captured in artifact admin-preview-evidence-158 (not committed to Git).
- Deployed Preview: success.
- Source screenshot matrix: 59 real PNGs; login shell: 16; read-only fixture module screens: 43; fixture metrics: 36.

### UI change and exact-SHA tests
- Scope: ADMIN-only CSS + regression assertions; no JavaScript business logic, API contract, Functions, data, migrations, secrets, bindings, or Cloudflare configuration changed.
- Source commit: `1fb56f7b5773876c581847bf44abbef1c5c16a67` — mobile product gallery makes the first image a prominent full-row cover, keeps supporting thumbnails in a responsive grid, and has light/dark rules.
- Regression test commit: `45f630e99cfd1dd047c234f0fb42fa197d9bc978` — contract assertions cover cover-row layout, full-composition image fit, narrow-phone fallback, dark theme and existing accessible reorder controls.
- Run [#157](`https://github.com/chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin/actions/runs/39615192697`): exact source SHA `1fb56f7b5773876c581847bf44abbef1c5c16a67`; `npm run check`, `npm test`, local Playwright screenshot matrix and configured Preview diagnostic all PASS.
- Run [#158](`https://github.com/chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin/actions/runs/39615417216`): exact tested SHA `45f630e99cfd1dd047c234f0fb42fa197d9bc978`; same checks all PASS. Artifact `admin-preview-evidence-158` (ID `12351884437`, expires 2026-11-04) has the 59 source/fixture screenshots (16 login-shell and 43 synthetic read-only module views) and 36 fixture metrics. This is not authenticated real-backend QA.
- Visual review of artifact 158's `product-gallery__390x844__light.png`: the primary image is now visually dominant; the screen remains vertically dense and the secondary thumbnail continues below the fixed action area when captured at this scroll position. The approved reference has a more dedicated image-manager composition, so this is a single incremental improvement, not 12-screen visual acceptance.
- Overall progress remains **48%**. All 12 reference-screen families: **NOT ACCEPTED**; authenticated business flows/backend QA: **NOT TESTED**; real photo upload/save: **DEFERRED_BY_OWNER / NOT VERIFIED**.
- The workflow saved run evidence and docs-only checkpoint at `068520e4ac62adc32ce5f15226e666479770af91`; handoff-only commits do not change the tested source SHA. Re-fetch the live branch ref before further work.

### Read-only PR scope/security finding
- PR [#111](https://github.com/chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin/pull/111) remains **OPEN / UNMERGED**, base `main`, 1,112 changed paths (+38,619/−392). Current path census: `docs/` 1,050 paths (including 913 PNG assets), 24 Functions files, 2 migrations, 5 scripts, 24 tests, 2 workflows, and root/data/public/package files; both `public/admin/index.html` and the unrelated `public/index.html` are in the PR diff. It is mixed-scope and **not merge-ready**.
- The PR contains `scripts/setup-cloudflare.mjs`, which can execute remote D1 schema SQL/ALTER statements and then a Pages deployment after interactive confirmation, and `scripts/deploy-cloudflare.mjs`, which performs remote schema checks and a Pages deploy. They were read only and **not executed**. Migrations 0008/0009 were inspected as source only; no migration ledger/schema verification against remote D1 was performed.
- Keep PR #111 and [PR #108](https://github.com/chichute5500/Sindarealest-admin/pull/108) OPEN. PR #108 is OPEN/UNMERGED with 269 changed files. Do not silently retarget/split/merge either PR or edit other branches without explicit authorization.

### Immutable safety boundaries
- Only write on `feature/admin-isolated-handoff-2026-10-20`; do not edit `main` or `fix/liquid-glass-audit-2026-10-19`.
- No merge/cherry-pick/force-push or Production deploy.
- No secret/Cloudflare Access changes or bypass, remote D1/R2/schema/data writes, setup/migration script execution, or TinyFish.
- Product image-save and PRE/PRO migration remain deferred by the owner. Continue source-only responsive/accessibility/reference audit and PR diff review; test every source change on its exact SHA, and update handoff docs after evidence is verified.
